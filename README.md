## 🏠 Roommate Sync

**Smart Compatibility Matching Before Finding a Place**

Roommate Sync is a lifestyle-based roommate compatibility platform designed to help people **find the right roommate first**, before searching for a PG or apartment together.

Instead of forcing random co-living, our system focuses on aligning habits, preferences, and expectations to reduce future conflicts.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Most roommate problems happen due to:

* Different sleep schedules
* Cleanliness expectations
* Food preferences
* Budget comfort levels

Existing platforms focus mainly on **property listings**, not **human compatibility**.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

Roommate Sync flips the approach:

* First, match people
* Then, help compatible roommates find a place together

The platform generates a **compatibility score with clear lifestyle insights**.

---

## 🧩 Core Features (MVP)

* Secure login & signup using Firebase Authentication
* Multi-step lifestyle questionnaire
* Progress tracking during quiz
* Compatibility score generation
* Animated circular score visualization
* Insight cards explaining match quality
* Responsive premium UI (desktop & mobile)
