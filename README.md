🏠 Roommate Sync

Smart compatibility matching for stress-free shared living
🚀 Overview

Roommate Sync is a web-based platform designed to help people find compatible roommates before finding a place.
Instead of choosing accommodation first and adjusting later, we reverse the flow:
match people first → find a place together.

This approach reduces conflicts and creates healthier shared-living experiences.
